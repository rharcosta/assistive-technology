## tecnologia-assistiva

This is my Completion of Course Work (TCC) project that was carried out in 2018 during my high school education concurrently with the IT Technician, at the institution CEMEP - Paul√≠nia.
The focus was to develop a prototype of a simple and improved **assistive keyboard** for all mutes or voiceless users. Several applications were also implemented that were taught during the technician, such as opening a calendar, calculator, Windows Explorer and text editor, in order to put the learning into practice.
- Final Grade: 9.0
